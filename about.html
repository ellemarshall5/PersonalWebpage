      <p>
        As a girl growing up in Utah, whether it was in wood shop or in computer class, I was 
        encouraged to take a back seat to the boys in my classes, despite my ability to perform 
        alongside them. As an adult, I’ve realized that I have the power to change my 
        circumstances, and for that reason, I’ve chosen recently to go back to school and study 
        Computer Science. Jumping into the tech world is not only an opportunity to re-write my 
        past, it’s an opportunity to step into the future.

        Between raising my three year old son, attending school and working, I try to fit in some
        of my favorite hobbies. Whether it be hiking, baking, woodworking or renovating a house 
        there is always something to keep me busy. Currently my partner and I (along with our kids) 
        are in the process of renovating three homes. We have a passion for restoring homes to their
        former glory and ensuring they will last several lifetimes.

        Once I am done with my degree my goal is to use my degree to build our little empire. We have 
        big goals. Our dream is to one day is to build and design our own homes, own a small store, 
        an event center and I plan to bring my home decor business back. Years ago I had an Etsy shop
        selling hand made cake stands that really started to take off. I was featured in national
        publications and had a few segments on local morning shows.

       <p>
         My hope is that I can use my talents to make my small corner of the world a better place. To bring
         back pride in our homes and show that you don't need a 4,000 sq ft house to have a beautiful home. 
         Everyone should live a pretty life and I want to help make that happen.
